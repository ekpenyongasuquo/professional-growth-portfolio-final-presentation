    <p>IT 497 – Final Portfolio (Week 6 Submission)</p>

    <h2>Introduction: A Coherent Journey of Discipleship and Professional Purpose</h2>
    <p>
        This portfolio represents the culmination of my spiritual and professional development throughout this course.
        I have come to understand that my identity as a disciple of Jesus Christ directly shapes my identity as an
        aspiring cybersecurity and IT professional. My guiding principles—faith, integrity, discipline, stewardship,
        and service—now inform how I think, make decisions, and interact with others in academic and professional
        environments. These principles align with the doctrine that all aspects of life should be gathered together in
        Christ, influencing both personal character and professional conduct (Bednar, 2018).
    </p>
    <p>
        As I reflect on my journey, I recognize that spiritual progression and professional growth are not separate
        paths but integrated responsibilities. My commitment to ethical technology use, data protection, and responsible
        system administration is an extension of my discipleship and covenant commitment to act with honesty,
        accountability, and love toward others (The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 2013).
    </p>

    <h2>Spiritual Progression Portfolio</h2>

    <h3>Depth of Reflection on Spiritual Growth</h3>
    <p>
        Throughout this course, I experienced profound spiritual refinement as I intentionally evaluated my thoughts,
        decisions, and reliance on the Savior. I recognized moments where impatience, self-reliance, and performance
        pressure challenged my discipleship. These moments became sacred opportunities for repentance, humility, and
        increased dependence on divine guidance. I learned that spiritual growth is not passive; it requires consistent
        faith, effort, and accountability, much like climbing a personal “Mount Sinai” of refinement and covenant
        commitment (Hurley, n.d.).
    </p>
    <p>
        This reflection helped me see that becoming a trusted disciple in my field means aligning my daily actions with
        Christlike attributes such as patience, honesty, compassion, and diligence. I now approach academic work,
        peer collaboration, and future employment as opportunities to represent my faith through ethical behavior and
        service to others (Morrison, n.d.).
    </p>

    <h3>Application of Spiritual Principles in Real Life</h3>
    <p>
        I applied spiritual principles by receiving peer feedback with humility, responding with gratitude rather than
        defensiveness, and revising my work to reflect higher standards of integrity and clarity. In group discussions,
        I practiced Christlike communication by being respectful, supportive, and solution-focused. These experiences
        strengthened my commitment to live gospel principles not only in worship but also in academic and professional
        responsibilities (Bednar, 2018).
    </p>

    <h3>Future Spiritual Goals as a Disciple</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Maintain daily prayer and scripture study to seek guidance in decisions</li>
        <li>Evaluate ethical dilemmas through gospel-centered principles</li>
        <li>Serve and mentor others using Christlike leadership</li>
        <li>Remain accountable for continuous spiritual repentance and growth</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Professional Growth Portfolio</h2>

    <h3>Professional Development and Ethical Responsibility</h3>
    <p>
        This course strengthened my understanding that technical competence must always be governed by ethical
        responsibility. As a future cybersecurity professional, I will handle sensitive data, system access controls,
        and digital infrastructure that impact real people. Viewing technology stewardship as a sacred trust helps me
        avoid misuse of technical skills and instead prioritize confidentiality, integrity, and responsible monitoring.
        This perspective aligns with gospel teachings on honesty and accountability in all professional dealings
        (The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 2013).
    </p>

    <h3>Technical Skills and Context-Based Ethical Application</h3>
    <p>
        Through my coursework in networking, scripting, cloud technologies, and security operations, I developed skills
        in system configuration, monitoring, and secure data handling. I now apply these skills with an ethical
        framework, ensuring that privacy, compliance, and responsible system use guide all technical decisions. For
        example, when analyzing logs or configuring access permissions, I view each action as impacting real users who
        deserve protection and trust. This ethical approach prepares me to responsibly manage user data in real-world IT
        environments where trust and compliance are critical (Hurley, n.d.).
    </p>

    <h3>Career Vision and Professional Mission</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Develop advanced competencies in cybersecurity and cloud security</li>
        <li>Uphold ethical data protection and privacy standards</li>
        <li>Apply integrity, discipline, and stewardship in all technical roles</li>
        <li>Create secure systems that positively impact individuals and organizations</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Detailed Action Plan for Ongoing Spiritual and Professional Development</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Set quarterly spiritual reflection and professional growth goals</li>
        <li>Participate in ethical cybersecurity and compliance training</li>
        <li>Seek mentorship from faith-centered and industry professionals</li>
        <li>Evaluate major career decisions using gospel and ethical frameworks</li>
        <li>Engage in service-oriented technology projects that benefit others</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Reflective Essay: Alignment With My Goals and Their Evolution</h2>
    <p>
        At the beginning of this course, my goals were primarily focused on academic achievement and technical
        excellence. Over time, those goals evolved to include character development, ethical responsibility, and
        Christlike service. I now recognize that professional success without spiritual grounding is incomplete. My
        refined vision is to become a cybersecurity professional who not only protects systems but also blesses lives
        through ethical leadership and trustworthy service.
    </p>
    <p>
        This portfolio demonstrates how my goals shifted from performance-driven ambitions to purpose-driven
        discipleship. I now measure success not only by technical competence but also by integrity, accountability, and
        the positive impact I have on others. This evolution reflects my commitment to lifelong growth as a disciple of
        Jesus Christ and a responsible IT professional (Bednar, 2018; Morrison, n.d.).

    <h2>Portfolio Peer Reviews Report</h2>

    <h3>Peer Review 1 – Feedback Given and Received</h3>
    <p>
        In my first peer review, I provided feedback emphasizing deeper integration of guiding principles and clearer
        examples of spiritual application. The feedback I received highlighted the need for stronger narrative cohesion
        and more explicit connections between my faith and professional decisions. I implemented this feedback by
        expanding my reflections, adding concrete ethical examples, and strengthening the integration between spiritual
        discipleship and cybersecurity responsibilities.
    </p>

    <h3>Peer Review 2 – Feedback Given and Implementation</h3>
    <p>
        During the second peer review, I suggested that my classmate include clearer future-oriented goals and practical
        service applications. The feedback I received encouraged more specificity in my action plan and clearer
        articulation of how technical skills align with ethical stewardship. I implemented this by refining my action
        plan, adding measurable development goals, and explicitly connecting my technical cybersecurity role to service,
        trust, and protection of others.
