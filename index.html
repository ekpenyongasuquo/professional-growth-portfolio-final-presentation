    <h1>Spiritual Progression & Professional Growth Portfolio</h1>

    <p>IT 497 – Final Portfolio (Week 6)</p>
</header>

<section>
    <h2>Introduction: A Coherent Journey</h2>
    <p>
        This portfolio represents the culmination of my spiritual and professional development throughout this course.
        I now understand spiritual growth and professional growth as deeply interconnected paths. My guiding principles—
        faith, integrity, accountability, service, and stewardship—shape both my discipleship as a follower of Jesus Christ
        and my ethical practice in the information technology field.
    </p>

    <h2>Spiritual Progression Portfolio</h2>

    <h3>Reflection on Growth</h3>
    <p>
        Throughout this course, I experienced meaningful spiritual refinement through intentional reflection on my
        values, decision-making, and reliance on Christ. I learned that spiritual growth requires humility,
        accountability, and consistent effort. Moments of impatience and self-reliance revealed areas where I needed
        greater trust in God and Christlike patience.
    </p>

    <h3>Application of Spiritual Principles</h3>
    <p>
        I applied principles such as honesty, patience, accountability, and service in academic and professional
        settings. By receiving and implementing peer feedback with humility, I strengthened my ability to align my
        actions with gospel principles and demonstrate integrity through behavior.
    </p>

    <h3>Future Spiritual Goals</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Maintain consistent prayer and scripture study</li>
        <li>Seek spiritual guidance in ethical and career decisions</li>
        <li>Serve others through Christlike leadership and mentorship</li>
        <li>Remain accountable for personal growth and discipleship</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Professional Growth Portfolio</h2>

    <h3>Professional Development Reflection</h3>
    <p>
        This course clarified the importance of ethical responsibility in information technology. I gained a deeper
        appreciation for how technical competence must be guided by integrity, accountability, and respect for others,
        especially when handling sensitive data and system access.
    </p>

    <h3>Technical Skills and Ethical Application</h3>
    <p>
        I engaged with industry-relevant concepts related to data handling, system monitoring, and privacy. This ethical
        approach prepares me to responsibly manage user data in real-world IT environments where trust, compliance, and
        confidentiality are critical. I now approach technology as a stewardship responsibility rather than merely a
        technical challenge.
    </p>

    <h3>Career Vision</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Develop technical competencies aligned with industry standards</li>
        <li>Uphold ethical practices in data privacy and cybersecurity</li>
        <li>Apply integrity and accountability in professional decision-making</li>
        <li>Create technology solutions that positively impact others</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Detailed Action Plan for Ongoing Development</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Set quarterly goals for spiritual reflection and professional growth</li>
        <li>Participate in ethical training and professional development opportunities</li>
        <li>Seek mentorship and accountability</li>
        <li>Evaluate decisions using spiritual and ethical frameworks</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Reflective Essay: Alignment and Evolution</h2>
    <p>
        My initial goals focused primarily on technical skills and academic success. Over time, these goals evolved to
        emphasize character, ethical responsibility, and service. This portfolio reflects a holistic vision that
        integrates faith, professionalism, and lifelong discipleship.

    <h2>Portfolio Peer Reviews Report</h2>

    <h3>Peer Review 1</h3>
    <p>
        Feedback emphasized deeper integration of guiding principles. I implemented this feedback by expanding my
        reflective sections and improving narrative cohesion.
    </p>

    <h3>Peer Review 2</h3>
    <p>
        Feedback encouraged more specificity and practical examples. I responded by adding ethical decision-making
        examples and strengthening my action plan.
