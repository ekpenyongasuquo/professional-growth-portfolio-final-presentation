    <p>IT 497 – Final Portfolio (Week 6)</p>
</header>

<section>
    <h2>Introduction: A Coherent Journey of Discipleship and Professional Purpose</h2>
    <p>
        This portfolio represents a deeply reflective synthesis of my spiritual discipleship and professional
        preparation in the field of cybersecurity. Throughout this course, I have come to recognize that my
        guiding principles—faith in Jesus Christ, integrity, accountability, stewardship, and service—are not
        separate from my career aspirations but foundational to them. As Elder Bednar teaches, gathering all
        things in Christ requires aligning every aspect of life, including education and work, with spiritual
        purpose (Bednar, 2018). This understanding has reshaped how I view both my personal growth and my
        responsibilities as a future cybersecurity professional entrusted with safeguarding sensitive systems
        and data.
    </p>

    <h2>Spiritual Progression Portfolio</h2>

    <h3>Depth of Reflection on Spiritual Growth</h3>
    <p>
        During this course, I recognized that spiritual progression is not passive but requires deliberate
        humility, repentance, and trust in the Savior. I noticed moments when I relied excessively on my own
        abilities, especially while completing technical assignments under pressure. These experiences exposed
        a personal warning sign—self-reliance replacing spiritual dependence. Through prayer and reflection,
        I learned to pause, seek divine guidance, and approach challenges with patience and faith rather than
        anxiety. This aligns with the principle that faith and effort together lead to spiritual growth and
        refined character (Hurley, n.d.).
    </p>

    <h3>Application of Guiding Principles in Daily Life</h3>
    <p>
        I intentionally applied Christlike attributes—honesty, patience, accountability, and charity—when
        collaborating with classmates, receiving feedback, and completing assignments. For example, during peer
        reviews, I practiced humility by accepting constructive criticism and implementing suggested
        improvements. This demonstrated my commitment to integrity and teachability, qualities essential for
        discipleship and ethical professional conduct. I learned that true discipleship is reflected in daily
        actions, not only in beliefs (Morrison, n.d.).
    </p>

    <h3>Future Spiritual Goals as a Disciple of Jesus Christ</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Maintain daily prayer and scripture study to strengthen spiritual sensitivity</li>
        <li>Seek divine guidance before making major academic and career decisions</li>
        <li>Develop Christlike leadership through mentorship and service</li>
        <li>Continually evaluate my choices against gospel-centered values</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Professional Growth Portfolio</h2>

    <h3>Integration of Spiritual Values with Professional Identity</h3>
    <p>
        This course deepened my understanding that technical expertise without ethical and spiritual grounding
        can lead to misuse of technology. As a future cybersecurity professional, I will handle confidential
        information and system access that require absolute integrity and accountability. My spiritual
        commitment to honesty and stewardship directly informs how I will design, secure, and manage digital
        systems. I now see cybersecurity not merely as a technical discipline but as a sacred trust to protect
        individuals and organizations from harm.
    </p>

    <h3>Application of Technical Skills with Ethical Responsibility</h3>
    <p>
        Through my academic coursework in networking, system configuration, and security operations, I developed
        foundational technical competencies relevant to real-world IT environments. I applied these skills with
        an ethical mindset, recognizing that improper access, data mishandling, or negligence could negatively
        impact users. This course reinforced my commitment to implementing secure configurations, respecting
        user privacy, and following ethical cybersecurity practices that prevent misuse of technology.
    </p>

    <h3>Career Vision and Service-Oriented Impact</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Develop advanced cybersecurity and ethical hacking competencies</li>
        <li>Apply integrity when managing sensitive data and system privileges</li>
        <li>Design secure systems that protect individuals and organizations</li>
        <li>Use my technical expertise to serve and uplift others responsibly</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Detailed Action Plan for Ongoing Spiritual and Professional Development</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Set quarterly spiritual and professional growth goals and review progress</li>
        <li>Engage in continuous cybersecurity training and ethical certification programs</li>
        <li>Seek mentorship from experienced IT and faith-centered leaders</li>
        <li>Evaluate decisions using both gospel principles and professional ethical standards</li>
        <li>Participate in service opportunities that use my technical skills to bless others</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Reflective Essay: Alignment with Initial Goals and Evolution</h2>
    <p>
        At the beginning of this course, my goals focused mainly on academic achievement and acquiring technical
        skills. However, through reflection and spiritual learning, my goals evolved to emphasize character,
        discipleship, and ethical responsibility. I now understand that professional success without spiritual
        alignment is incomplete. This portfolio reflects that transformation: my objectives now integrate faith,
        service, and technical excellence into a unified life purpose. My journey demonstrates that spiritual
        growth strengthens professional competence by guiding ethical decisions and fostering resilience.

    <h2>Portfolio Peer Reviews Report</h2>

    <h3>Peer Review 1: Feedback Given and Received</h3>
    <p>
        In the first peer review, I provided feedback encouraging my peer to strengthen the connection between
        guiding principles and career goals. I received feedback suggesting that I provide more concrete
        examples of how spiritual values influence my professional behavior. I implemented this feedback by
        adding detailed examples of ethical decision-making and accountability in my coursework and future
        cybersecurity responsibilities.
    </p>

    <h3>Peer Review 2: Implementation of Feedback</h3>
    <p>
        During the second peer review, I emphasized the importance of clarity and cohesive narrative flow when
        evaluating my peer’s portfolio. In return, I received feedback recommending a clearer articulation of
        my long-term commitment as a disciple of Jesus Christ. I implemented this by expanding my future goals,
        explicitly describing how my faith will guide my leadership, service, and ethical decision-making in
        my career.
    </p>

<section>
    <h2>Conclusion: A Forward-Looking Commitment</h2>
    <p>
        This portfolio represents my commitment to lifelong growth as both a disciple of Jesus Christ and a
        cybersecurity professional. I will continue striving to align my technical expertise with Christlike
        attributes, ensuring that my work promotes trust, protects others, and reflects gospel-centered values.
        By integrating faith with professional development, I am preparing to become a capable, ethical, and
        service-oriented technology leader who uses knowledge to bless and safeguard others.
